The average income is 55.17k and 54.94k for control and test group respectively and the percentage differece is only 0.41% which indicates the two groups are very similar regarding to income. In order to verify the two groups of people are really statistically similar in income, I used two sample t-test to test the hypothesis that the average income of the two groups are equal. The result tells p value is greater than 0.05(significance level), we can not reject the null hypothesis which means I accept it.\n",

    "From the analysis result from Q2, the promotion effect on purchase rate of male vs. female is similar. But for gamers vs. non-gamers, the t-c difference for non-gamers is negative which means the promotion actually discouraged them to purchase. It's understandable that people don't play games feels annoyed when we show too much game ads to them. \n",

However for expected revenue, the promotion ads result in 16.4% increase for female gamers but 9.28% decrease for male gamers. Consequently, Game-Fun should focus on female gamers for promotion ads in the future."

In addition, the promotion has raised 3.57% and 20.61% for the expected revenue on site 1 and 2 respectively. We could say that the promotion ads for site 2 is more effective so we could focus more on this site. However, of course we should take the ads cost into consideration to evaluate ROI from both sites to make final desicion."
