# Digital Advertising A/B Testing Analysis and Report
This is a personal project.

Note: the company "GameFun" is made up due to confidential reasons.

### Goal
This project aims to analyze the digital ads A/B testing result for a mobile game company and create a business report with insights and further recommendations.

### Analysis
In order to measure the effectiveness of digital Ads, GameFun ran an online display banners advertising campaign with the primary objective of increasing its sales on gaming subscription packages and conducted an A/B test to measure the causal effect.

I first checked whether the A/B test were conducted properly by using T-test to validate the test and control group are similar and comparable. Then I calculated several key metrics for the two groups and for specific customer segments as well.

### Result
GameFun can run the promotion continuously according to the A/B test result and they should only focus on female gamers. Because only in this customer segment, the promotion ads effect on revenue/sales is positive (+16.4%).

However, the promotion ads did improve the purchase rate (4%) for all the customers. Game Fun could continue to conduct this campaign on all the customers only when their goal is to gain more customers regardless of the cost.
